# GameShell-nxengine-evo
Run nxenginve-evo (Cave Story) on your GameShell!

Just copy the contents of the `games` folder to your GameShell's `games` folder (in other words, merge the two games folders). Then place the `CaveStoryEvo` folder somewhere in your launcher. I put mine right in the base at `/home/cpi/apps/Menu/`. Running CaveStoryEvo from the launcher should copy all needed files from the original Cave Story that comes preinstalled.

Enjoy!
